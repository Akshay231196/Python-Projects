# Employee Attrition Prediction with HR Analytics
This project predicts whether candidates seek a job change after training using the HR dataset. It includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding), feature engineering, and training a Random Forest classifier. Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV optimizes performance for better predictions.
